One day in house 19

who in the kitchen

who is cooking

who is laughing


Julia got some basils

from her garden

Yeli got some flowers

she put it in the kitchen


We have sadness, and we have joy

In house 19, people are sharing

We have worries, we have hoping

In house 19, people are praying


Wu…Wu…Wu…Wu…


Jeremiah told me what god is

I met Yidi in Ruggles church

Daniel's smile can cure everything

Hyelim give me earplugs for my sleeping


I have been here for almost 1 year

Is there somewhere you feel at home

Are there some people you can trust with

Is there some time you can not forget

One day in house 19

The Sunshine is coming in

who in the kitchen

who is laughing


La la...
La la...
La la…

Wu…
Wu…
Wu…
Wu…


One day in house 19

who in the kitchen

who is cooking

who is laughing
